## Overview
We build and apply single-cell and multi-omic approaches to understand how epigenomic regulation shapes immunity and brain aging.

## Themes
- **Single-cell epigenomics in neurodegeneration**: chromatin accessibility and regulatory programs across brain cell types in aging and Alzheimer’s disease.
- **Immune–brain interactions**: peripheral immune states as a window into (and possible driver of) brain pathology.
- **Methods**: computational analysis, statistical modeling, and multi-omic integration.

## Ongoing directions
- Mapping regulatory networks across brain and immune compartments
- Linking gene–environment factors to epigenomic variation
- Translational biomarkers and intervention strategies
