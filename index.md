## About
We develop and apply single-cell and multi-omic technologies to study immunology and brain aging, with a focus on epigenomic mechanisms in neurodegeneration.

## Research areas
- Gene–environment regulation of immune and brain cell epigenomes
- Single-cell multi-omics in human brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease
- Diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer’s disease via peripheral immune cells

## News
- Website launched
- We are recruiting (computational and experimental) trainees — see [Join]({{ '/join/' | relative_url }}).
